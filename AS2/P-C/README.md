## Part C - Use an existing pre-trained CNN model for a real world application.

### Application - Detect stray animals on road

Object detection is the task of identifying objects (such as cars, trees, people, animals) in images. Over the past 6 years, there has been tremendous progress in object detection with very fast and accurate models available today. In this question you will use a pre-trained YoloV3 model and use it in an application of your choice. Here is a cool demo of YoloV2 (click on the image to see the demo on youtube).

The road accidents due to stray animals are very common in a country like India. Over 100 people get injured and more than 40 people die in a city every year, and this is only the recorded data. Many goes unreported. This figure has increased by 30% in 2021 alone. Due to industialisation, urbanisation and increasing population most of the families are moving to cities and the natural habitat for animals are decreasing. This results in the movement of stray animals into the busy roads. This leads to accidents and increase in  traffic. The duty of municipal department is to take action in the areas of cities where these movements are high. This action has to be rapid. 

We can prepare a model which will detect stray animals on the streets and can aware the municipal authorities in real time using the CCTV cameras on streets.

Another use case of this model can be implemented in the vehicles of the commuters. The camera in the car will look for possible interference stray animals and warn the driver about this otherwise this can be implemented directly into self driven cars.

This model can be used to detect dead animals on or nearby the streets which can be moved out by the municipal corporation timely.

In winters when visibility is low, we can implement this on the traffic lights which will signal red or orange if it sees animals nearby the traffic. The traffic lights are usually visible from distance as compared to animals.
