This assignment has three parts- <br>
Part A - Build a CNN model from scratch and learn how to tune the hyperparameters and visualise filters.<br>
Part B - Transfer learning and fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN model on a given dataset.<br>
Part C - Use an existing pre-trained CNN model for a real world application.<br>
